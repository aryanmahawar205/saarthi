You are an expert AI Security Analyst.

Evaluate the consolidated Security Knowledge Graph, Attack Paths, and Runtime Observations to provide deep security reasoning.

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH NODES (Summary):
{json.dumps(nodes_summary, indent=2)[:3000]}

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EDGES (Summary):
{json.dumps(edges_summary, indent=2)[:3000]}

RUNTIME OBSERVATIONS:
{json.dumps(runtime_observations, indent=2)[:2000]}

ATTACK PATHS:
{json.dumps(attack_paths, indent=2)[:2000]}

SAST FINDINGS:
{json.dumps(sast_incidents, indent=2)[:2000]}

DAST FINDINGS:
{json.dumps(dast_incidents, indent=2)[:2000]}

TRUST BOUNDARIES:
{json.dumps(trust_boundaries, indent=2)[:1000]}

Synthesize a comprehensive security reasoning that addresses:
1. Risk Score (0-100).
2. Overall Risk (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
3. Most Likely Attack (Easiest to execute given runtime behavior).
4. Most Dangerous Attack (Highest business impact).
5. Exploitability Assessment (How easy are these to exploit in the real world).
6. Business Impact (Impact on operations, data, reputation).
7. Prioritized Findings (Top 3 immediate concerns).
8. Remediation Priority (Which should be fixed first and why).
9. Remediation Order (Step-by-step sequence).

Return ONLY valid JSON in exactly this format:
{{
  "Risk Score": 0,
  "Overall Risk": "...",
  "Most Likely Attack": "...",
  "Most Dangerous Attack": "...",
  "Exploitability Assessment": "...",
  "Business Impact": "...",
